# Fractal R-tipping

This repository contains the code usd in the manuscript "Fractals in rate-induced tipping points" by Jason Wang, Yi Zheng, and [Eduardo G. Altmann](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/ega/) produced at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.

The code for the three dynamical systems treated in the manuscript (one-dimensional map, Henon map, and forced pendulum) is presented in different Jupyter notebooks. The source Python code is in the folder "src". Pre-computed data used in the figures is provided in the "data_pub". Yi Zheng coded the analysis of the Henon map and Jason Wang the one-dimensional map and forced pendulum.
